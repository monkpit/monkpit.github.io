# Make function parameters meaningful

Function parameters should be meaningfully named, but also meaningful in the context they're being used in.

```javascript
function runUserTests(
    isLoggedIn,
    isFreeTierUser,
    numberOfPastPurchases
) {
    if (!isLoggedIn) {
        login();
    }
    runAuthenticatedTests(isFreeTierUser, numberOfPastPurchases);
}
```

Consider the snippet of code above.

Reading the code like this pretty much makes sense.
The function accepts a boolean parameter that says whether the user is already logged in or not.
If not logged in, we run some helper function to login before running our tests.
When we run the tests, we pass in some parameters to further alter how the tests will run.
One parameter is a boolean, and the other is a number.

---

## In practice
However, consider coming across that function at the calling site:

```javascript
describe('Authentication', () => {
    it('can login and access user profile', () => {
        // what does this even mean?
        runUserTests(true, false, 3);
    });
});
```

It's confusing - what's `true, false, 3`?
What's the difference if it was `false, true, 5`?
It's hard to tell immediately without reading some kind of documentation.
Maybe if the reader is using an IDE they can examine the function signature without having to look up the definition...
But if the reader is reviewing a PR, then they will have to look up the definition.

## How to improve

If there is only 1 argument to a function, then the function can probably be renamed to make the argument more obvious.

```javascript
// rename this
initialize(3);

// to this - there's now a plural noun that describes what the number does
stagePassengers(3);
```

Or, with multiple arguments, either convert them to an object, or name them with variables.

```javascript
// instead of bare arguments that have no contextual meaning
runUserTests(true, false, 3);

// either name the arugments with variables (situational)
const isLoggedIn = true;
const isFreeTierUser = false;
const numberOfPastPurchases = 3;

runUserTests(isLoggedIn, isFreeTierUser, numberOfPastPurchases);

// or, convert the individual variables into an object (usually preferred)
const testOptions = {
    isLoggedIn: true,
    isFreeTierUser: false,
    numberOfPastPurchases: 3
};

runUserTests(testOptions);

// you could also create an anonymous object during the function call
// but it's less readable unless the object is very small

// ok:
stagePassengers({ age: 14, numberOfPassengers: 3 });

// too crowded:
runUserTests({ isLoggedIn: true, isFreeTierUser: false, numberOfPastPurchases: 3 });
```


## TL;DR
* Function arguments should be meaningful in context of the function call
  * Needs Improvment: `initialize(3)`
  * Better: `createPassengers(3)`
  * Needs improvement: `createPassenger(true)`
  * Better: `createPassenger({rewardsMember: true})`
  * Better: `createPassenger(passengerOptions)`
* If the meaning of a function's argument isn't immediately obvious, refactor.
Either change the name of the function, or convert the arguments to an object with appropriately named properties.
