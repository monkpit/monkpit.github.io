# Code should read like prose - mastering levels of abstraction

Well written code flows like a set of instructions.
It should be as clear and concise as any other form of writing.

If you were given a set of instructions for a task you had never done before, you should be able to read them and understand the overall task without needing to understand every last detail.
The writer should not have to express every last detail to you at the top level of the instructions.

```
To make a Peanut Butter sandwich:

* obtain bread
* obtain peanut butter
* obtain a knife
* obtain a plate
* put 2 pieces of bread on the plate
* use the knife to get some peanut butter
* using the knife, spread the peanut butter on 1 side of the bread
* close the 2 pieces together with peanut butter in the middle
* tidy up
* eat
```

In order for us to express these instructions, we don't have to tell the reader every last detail.

We don't say where to buy the peanut butter, or what size of plate is needed.
These details might be needed, but they're _implementation details_.
We can create the sandwich with peanut butter from any grocery store.
We can use any knife, but we can probably assume that a butter knife would be used.

## Code example

If you were presented with this code, you could read it and understand the role of each piece of the code without diving into the implementation details:

```javascript
function main() {
    const sandwichConfig = {
        numberOfSandwiches: 3,
        sandwichType: 'peanutbutter'
    };

    const sandwiches = makeSandwiches(sandwichConfig);
    serve(sandwiches);
}
```

If you were to dive down deeper into the implementation details, you can see more abstraction.
Exactly the same as before, we can understand the role and purpose of each variable and function without knowing the precise way that the functions are implemented.

```javascript
function makeSandwiches({numberOfSandwiches, sandwichType}) {
    const ingredients = getIngredients(sandwichType);
    const plates = stageSandwiches({numberOfSandwiches, ingredients});
    const sandwiches = plates.map(makeSandwich(sandwichType));

    return sandwiches;
}
```

And if you needed more details, you can dive into deeper levels of abstraction:

```javascript
const SLICES_PER_SANDWICH = 2;

function stageSandwiches({numberOfSandwiches, ingredients}) {
    ingredients.map(getIngredient);
    getKnife();
    
    const breadSlices = getBread(numberOfSandwiches * SLICES_PER_SANDWICH);
    const plates = getPlates(numberOfSandwiches);
    
    return plates.map(plate => {
        const bread = breadSlices.take(SLICES_PER_SANDWICH);
        plate.place(bread);
    });
}
```
