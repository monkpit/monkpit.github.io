# Do one thing

I find myself going back and forth on this, so I thought I should write it down once and for all.

I was faced with this code recently:

```javascript
// cy.fillForm exists in the codebase and
// accepts (selectors, data) arguments

Cypress.Commands.add('iframeFillForm',
  (iframeSelector, selectors, data) => {
    cy.iframe(iframeSelector).within(() => {
      // duplicated code from `cy.fillForm` pasted here
    });
  });
```

Of course, my natural inclination was to change it to this:

```javascript
Cypress.Commands.add('iframeFillForm',
  (iframeSelector, selectors, data) => {
    cy.iframe(iframeSelector).within(() => {
      cy.fillForm(selectors, data);
    });
  });
```

But then, my brain said: Keep it dry - why should we have 2 functions that do relatively the same thing?

## Fight the urge!

I had the urge to suggest adding an optional `iframeSelector` to the original implementation, which would have resulted in something along these lines:

```javascript
// axe `iframeFillForm` entirely - just pass an 
// optional `iframeSelector` as the final
// parameter of `fillForm`

Cypress.Commands.add('fillForm',
  (selectors, data, iframeSelector) => {
    if (iframeSelector) {
        cy.iframe(iframeSelector).within(() => {
          cy.fillForm(selectors, data);
        });
    } else {
        cy.fillForm(selectors, data);
    }
  });
```

Arguably, this function now does 2 different things, and has an unavoidable repitition of `cy.fillForm`.

It's ok to have two different (similar) functions that do two distinct things.
These don't need to be combined, and it just increases the complexity.
