# Simplify branching (if/else)

When writing branching logic (if/else), try to keep the number of branches minimal, and the branch bodies succinct.

One way to shorten branch bodies is to identify scenarios where there is duplicate code and pull it out of the branches completely.

---

## Example

Let's say we want to have two different sets of test steps based upon whether a user is logged in.

```javascript
if (userIsLoggedIn) {
    addProductToCart(product);
    openCart();
    validateCartContents([product]);
    validateUserNameIsShown(user.firstName);
    completePurchase();
} else {
    addProductToCart(product);
    openCart();
    validateCartContents([product]);
    completePurchase();
}
```

This code is arguably correct, and achieves our stated goal.

However, duplicating some of the test steps has led to extra lines of code.

What if the flow is changed in the future?
Now all branches have to be changed to match the new flow.

This might seem like a minor task, but it's [time-consuming for the future developer](../programming/respect-future-devs-time.md).

---

## Deduplication

How could the code be improved?

We could remove the duplication of some of the steps inside our `if/else`.

```javascript
addProductToCart(product);
openCart();
validateCartContents([product]);

if (userIsLoggedIn) {
    validateUserNameIsShown(user.firstName);
}

completePurchase();
```

The only part of the top `if` block that actually varied on `userIsLoggedIn` was `validateUserNameIsShown`.

---

## Why is it better?

Consider reading this code as a future developer with no context, and maybe even no ability to discuss the code with you, the original author.

The future developer will be reading this code for the first time, and does not know the difference between the `if` and `else` blocks yet.

---

### The rabbit hole

So, the developer starts by reading the `if` block.
They build up context, and reason about what is happening in the code, and try to figure out exactly what's going on.

Then they finish with the top `if` block - they understand it now, probably not fully, but enough to get by and continue reading the `else`.

They move on to the `else` and 1 of 2 things happens: either they recognize that the code is doing mostly the same thing, or they assume good faith and continue reading the code.

If they continue reading the code, they will spend roughly 2x as long to read and process both blocks.

If they stop and wonder, 'why is this duplicated?', then they might be led down a rabbit hole - surely if the code is duplicated, it was done for a reason.
But what reason?

They might ask around, other developers are now involved.
They read the code, and they don't know.
Change it and test it out, they say.

Now the developer is running the code just to solidify their understanding of how and why it works the way it does.
With any code, this takes time.
With Cypress code and a large test project, this takes considerable time.

## Save a rabbit - write concise code

If the original implementation is deduplicated, it clearly expresses the intended behavior.
The code will always do most of the steps, and in some special case it will also `validateUserNameIsShown`.
The intention is clear, and changes can be made much more easily, saving time on future dev work and maintenance.
